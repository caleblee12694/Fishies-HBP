## By Caleb Lee, Kyle Sung, and Jalen Wu

This is a full-stack application that leverages React Native to manage user activity on the frontend and 
utilizes Google Firebase on the backend to store relevant application data in a Firestore database. Expo framework was utilized for testing in an iOS/android/web environment.

Poqua is an aquarium tank monitor software application that gathers metrics such as water quality, temperature and 
light levels in a fish tank measured by hardware (DHT11 Temperature Module, Photoresistor, Turbidity sensor) 
that the user is intended to place in their personal fish tank. Poqua supports various user features, such as adding fish, viewing current fish, and setting reminders
for tasks to maintain their fish tank.
