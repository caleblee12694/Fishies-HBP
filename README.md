## By Caleb Lee, Kyle Sung, and Jalen Wu

This is a full-stack application that leverages React Native to manage user activity on the frontend and 
utilizes Google Firebase on the backend to store relevant application data in a Firestore database. Expo framework was utilized for testing in an iOS/android/web environment.

Fishies is an aquarium tank monitor software application that gathers metrics such as water quality, temperature and 
light levels in a fish tank measured by hardware (DHT11 Temperature Module, Photoresistor, Turbidity sensor) 
that the user is intended to place in their personal fish tank.
